# Documenting thoughts
> Hey, this is a directory to archive and document some of my most insane ideas.

### The main purpose of this document
This is definitely not a scientific paper. I just want to archive and describe quickly these random ideas that come up to my mind while I am showering or going to the gym for example.

### About the things written here
If you are reading this I hope you have fun reading it or get any kind of insight that can help you to build or create something.
